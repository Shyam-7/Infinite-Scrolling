# Social Media Feed with Infinite Scrolling

## Running the Application

1. Navigate to the project directory: `cd social-media-feed`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the React application: `http://localhost:3000`

## Implementation Details

### 1.  How would you implement infinite scrolling in a React component?


We use the `react-infinite-scroll-component` library:

- Wrap the list of posts with the `InfiniteScroll` component.
- Pass the current number of items, a function to load more items, and a boolean indicating if there are more items to load.
- The component automatically triggers the load function when the user scrolls near the bottom of the page.

### 2. Describe how to fetch and display additional posts as the user scrolls.

- Maintain a `page` state variable to track the current page of posts.
- Increment the `page` number when the user scrolls and triggers the load more function.
- Make an API call to fetch the next set of posts using the current `page` number.
- Append new posts to the existing list in the component's state.
- React re-renders the list, displaying the newly fetched posts.

### 3. How can you optimize the loading of posts to improve performance and user 
experience?
- Implement server-side pagination, fetching a limited number of posts per request.
- Utilize React's virtual DOM for efficient updates of new posts.
- Implement debouncing on the scroll event to prevent excessive API calls.
- Use lazy loading for images to reduce initial load time and save bandwidth.

### 4. Explain how you would handle loading states and display a spinner while new posts 
are being fetched.
- Use a `loading` state variable to track when posts are being fetched.
- Set `loading` to `true` when initiating a fetch.
- Display a spinner or loading message while `loading` is `true`.
- Set `loading` back to `false` once the fetch is complete.
- Utilize the `InfiniteScroll` component's built-in props for loading indicators.

### 5. What are the potential challenges with infinite scrolling, and how would you address 
them?

1. Performance degradation with large datasets:
- Implement virtual scrolling to render only visible items.
- Periodically remove old posts from the DOM as new ones are added.

2. Difficulty in reaching footer content:
- Implement a "Back to Top" button.
- Consider a hybrid approach with pagination for important footer content.

3. SEO issues:
- Implement server-side rendering for initial content.
- Use proper semantic HTML and implement schemes for better indexing.

4. Browser history and deep linking:
- Implement URL-based pagination to allow sharing of specific content sections.

5. Accidental refresh causing loss of scroll position:
- Implement scroll position restoration using browser APIs or state management.
